notes:

1. Change Amount and Change Speed (p_arp_mod and p_arp_speed) can always be zero.
   This means that arp_mod is always one, arp_limit is always zero, and arp_time doesn't matter.

2. Slide and Delta Slide are very similar. Consider removing Delta Slide.
   This means that fdslide is always zero and fslide remains constant.

3. Focus on either sawtooth or sinewave (or flip between the two with a button).
   This means that p_duty, p_duty_ramp, square_duty, and square_slide are meaningless.

4. Consider keeping fixed values of the Attack Time, Sustain Time, Sustain Punch, and Decay Time.
   This means that p_env_attack, p_env_sustain, p_env_decay, and p_env_punch are constant.
   Instead let's make a variable repeat rate and adjust these values according to the repeat rate.
   For example, set p_env_punch and p_env_sustain to zero,
                p_env_attack between 0.01 and 0.1, and p_env_decay between 0.3 and 0.7,
                according to the repetition rate.

5. Min Frequency is meaningless (or doesn't work for some reason).
   Keep p_freq_limit to zero, which means that f_max_period can be infinity (or, say, 44100).

6. Repeat Speed can be zero.
   This means that p_repeat_speed is zero and rep_limit and rep_time are meaningless.

7. Phaser Offset and Phaser Sweep (p_pha_offset and p_pha_ramp) can always be zero.
   This means that fphase, fdphase, iphase, ipp, and phaser_buffer are meaningless.
